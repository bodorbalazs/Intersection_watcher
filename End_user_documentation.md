This software is capable of solving cross line intersection in order to use it, one must input 4 strings with space between the strings.
These strings consist of maximum 2 letters. If a car does not come from a direction use an underscore "_" .
If there is a car then the first letter must be its type, which can be a normal car "C" or an ambulance "A".
The second letter shall be its intended direction, direction allowed: Straight: "S", Left : "L", Right: "R".
The incoming directions are as follows: The first string is a vehicle coming from the top, next one from the right then the bottom and left at the last position.
An example use of the rules above: "_ CL CS AR".
If a correct input is entered then the application will answer with the correct order of the passing vehicles.
The output is the order of the vehicles where "T" means the vehicle who comes from the top, "R" means the one coming from the right "B" means bottom and "L" means left.
An example of an output is: RBL which means the vehicle coming from the right goes first, then the one from bottom and the last one shall be the one who came from left.
